## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. Here are some sample classification results:

| Image      | Predicted Label | Confidence |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| apple1.jpg | Apple           | 100%        |
| orange1.jpg| Orange          | 100%        |
